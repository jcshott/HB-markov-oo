I stay out too late.
Got nothing in my brain.
That's what people say, mmm-mmm.
That's what people say, mmm-mmm.

I go on too many dates.
But I can't make them stay.
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm.
That's what people say, mmm-mmm.

But I keep cruising.
Can't stop, won't stop moving.
It's like I got this music.
In my mind.
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
I shake it off.
Heart-breakers gonna break.
And the fakers gonna fake.
Baby, I'm just gonna shake.
I shake it off!

I never miss a beat.
I'm lightning on my feet.
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm.
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm.

I'm dancing on my own.
I make the moves up as I go.
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm.
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm.

But I keep cruising.
Can't stop, won't stop grooving.
It's like I got this music
in my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

Hey, hey, hey!
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world.
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend.
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair.
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake.

Yeah ohhh!


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Saw you there and I thought
oh my God, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake.
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie,
I can read you like a magazine.
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
and I know you heard about me.
So hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand.
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever!
Or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over,
if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex­lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players
and you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless!
We'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless
or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex­lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby.
And I'll write your name.
Cherry lips, crystal skies,
I could show you incredible things.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies.
you're the King, baby, I'm your Queen.
Find out what you want.
Be that girl for a month.
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no!
Screaming, crying, perfect storms!
I can make all the tables turn.
Rose garden filled with thorns.
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy.
But you'll come back each time you leave.
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
So it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex­lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players.
And you love the game.
'Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless
or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex­lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby.
And I'll write your name.
Boys only want love if it's torture
don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya.
Boys only want love if it's torture.
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya.

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd.
And say, "Hello, ".
Little did I know.
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet.
And I was crying on the staircase
begging you Please don't go.
And I said.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes.
So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes. Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.
'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet.
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you please don't go.
And I said.
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story  baby just say yes.
Romeo, save me they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh oh.
I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
when I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said.
Romeo, save me I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone.
I love you and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad ­go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes.
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!
